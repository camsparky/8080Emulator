# 8080Emulator
Intel 8080 microprocessor emulator project. I made this to learn how emulators work fundamentally and to improve my systems programming knowledge
# TO DO
- Create a makefile, simplifying the compilation of the executable
- Implement every 8080 opcode
- Create a main function to launch the emulator
